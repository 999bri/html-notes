# HTML
## Intro to HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:
- a markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text
- in HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements
- HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks

## The Body
`<body>` `</body>`

Many different types of content like text, images, and buttons can be added into the body.

## HTML Structure
When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element; nested; they are either separated by an indentation or two spaces for better readability 

Since there are multiple levels of nesting, the analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. This is known as hierarchy.

## Headings
In HTML, there are six different headings or heading elements. These headings are sorted from largest to smallest. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
