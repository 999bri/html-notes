# Intro to HTML
## Displaying Text
If you want to display text, you could use a paragraph or span:
- paragraphs (`<p>`) contain a block of plain text
- `<span>` contains short pieces of text or other HTML; used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content; best to use when targeting a specific piece of content that is *inline* or on the same line as other text 

If you want to divide content into blocks, it's better to use `<div>`. 

i.e.:

`<div>`

  `<p>` `<span>`Skulls`</span>` are a bone protective layer for the brain.`</p>`
  
`</div>`
