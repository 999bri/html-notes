# HTML
## Intro to HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:
- a markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text
- in HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements
- HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks

## The Body
`<body>` `</body>`

Many different types of content like text, images, and buttons can be added into the body.

## HTML Structure
When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element; nested; they are either separated by an indentation or two spaces for better readability 

Since there are multiple levels of nesting, the analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. This is known as hierarchy.

## Headings
In HTML, there are six different headings or heading elements. These headings are sorted from largest to smallest. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`

## Divs
`<div>` is short for "division" or a container that divides the page into sections; useful for grouping elements; no visual representation, but useful when wanting to apply custom styles through CSS

They could also contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. 

## Attributes
Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling.

They are made up of the following two parts:
- the name of the attribute
- the value of the attribute

One commonly used attribute is `id`. This attribute is used to specify different content like `<div>`s and helpful when using an element more than once.

i.e.:
`<div id="intro">`
